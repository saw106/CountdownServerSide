Required to start backend:
	Vagrant

Once you have Vagrant installed and working, do `vagrant up` in the base directory to start the server.

Next you can access the server via `vagrant ssh`.
	All files in the project folder are in /vagrant.
	To provision the server(update so you can use Flask, etc) please do `sudo /vagrant/bootstrap.sh`

When you want to shut down the VM, use `vagrant halt` and NOT `vagrant destroy`, we don't want to waste time provisioning more than once.

Start the rest API/server with `python RestEntry.py`.

The SQLite database is file based and needs no setup besides initializing with `python setUpDB.py`
