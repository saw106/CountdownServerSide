Required to start backend:
	Vagrant
	VirtualBox

Once you have Vagrant installed and working, do `vagrant up` in the base directory to start the server.

Next you can access the server via `vagrant ssh`.
	All files in the project folder are in /vagrant.
	To provision the server(update so you can use Flask, etc) please do `cd /vagrant; sudo ./bootstrap.sh`
		This may break due to what appears to be some invisible characters. in that case, just run the individual commands from bootstrap.sh individually.

When you want to shut down the VM, use `vagrant halt` and NOT `vagrant destroy`, we don't want to waste time provisioning more than once.

IN THE TOP LEVEL DIRECTORY:
Start the rest API/server with `python RestEntry.py`.

The SQLite database is file based and needs no setup besides initializing with `python setUpDB.py`

UNIT TESTS:
First, run setUpTestDB.py to populate the test database. Then you can run the unit tests in TestDBResources.py.

Similarly, run setUpDB.py to set up the database in order to run the functional tests in APITest.py.
